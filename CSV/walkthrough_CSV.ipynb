It opens a file in Python and returns a `fileobject` that has specific attributes and methods (functions specific to a data type).\nTo make sure our code runs smoothly, we can add a `with` statement. A `with` statement handles exceptions and automatically closes the file after you're done, so it's a super easy and less messy way to deal with all the complicated things a computer might do!\nWhat this line says translate to the code below. This is long and confusing, and a `with` statement makes the code much cleaner."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"csvfile = open('test.csv')\ndata_reader = csv.reader(csvfile)\nfor row in data_reader:\n    print(','.join(row))\ncsvfile.close()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is `.join` doing?\n\nAs you may have suspected, `.join` is a function that puts a list strings together with a specific string in between each element.

Note that when we read the file, each row becomes a list. So the first row will be something like `row1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']`.
