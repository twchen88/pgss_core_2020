    "Have you ever used [one of these](https://inventwithpython.com/cipherwheel/)? The bulk of the logic in both of the cipher codes works in a similar way! If you haven't used one of these before, it's a little tool to help you encode (or decode) a message - to encode a certain letter, find the letter on the outside circle and change it to whatever that letter matches up with on the inside circle. For example, you might spin the outer circle so that \"A\" on the outside lines up with \"C\" on the inside. Then, \"PGSS\" would be encoded as \"RIUU\". You can decode by going from the inside circle to the outside circle. This physical representation might be useful to keep in mind!"
